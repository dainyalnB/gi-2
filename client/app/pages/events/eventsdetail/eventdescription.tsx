                    <p className="detail"> 
                        We did it again! Actionable Insights has created an entirely new class designed to equip attendees with the knowledge and resources required to succeed in the digital age of estimating and adjusting. 
                        This course is an immersive experience that walks you through an actual CAT 2 commercial water loss claim. 
                        If you’re brand new to estimating, you will likely struggle to keep up. 
                        This class covers some advanced concepts to include digital assets, 3D scans, shared walls, subrogation, Cat 2 PPEs, reasonable uniform appearance etc. 
                        Ideally, students should have some sort of Xactimate foundation established, but if you’re starting from scratch we can proudly say there’s no better place to learn how to do things the right way!

                        During the day, we will explore our new training curriculum which is designed to ensure users can leverage digital assets and develop the mission-critical skills required to generate a sophisticated estimate.

                        At night, we enter into the gamification aspect of the course. 
                        Students will compete against one another in an effort to deliver the most accurate mitigation/repair estimates. 
                        These exercises are powered by our proprietary 3D Training Modules – not only does this technology deliver a rich and engaging learning environment, but those that choose not to attend may be left behind by the industry’s rapid adoption of 3D technology.

                        OPINION:
                    </h3>
                    <p className="detail"> 
                        In our opinion, too much credence and attention is given to the sketch aspect as it relates to Xactimate training. 
                        In fact, a part of this class shows attendees why it’s possible to never sketch again! We believe there should be an increased focus on determining what line items most accurately/optimally represent cost and scope, and subsequently organizing them in a thoughtful way. 
                        That is the key to generating estimates that can be approved without hesitation.
